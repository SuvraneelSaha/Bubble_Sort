        // best case - O(n) -- when the array is sorted
        // worst case - O(n^2) -- when the array is sorted in the opposite way ie
        // when the array is in descending order and we need to sort the array in an ascending order.

        // here imagine n is the no. of comparisons


        // IMPORTANT -- AS THE INPUT GROWS HOW THE TIME GROWS THIS IS KNOWN AS TIME COMPLEXITY
        // As the size of the array is growing the no, of comparisons is also growing
